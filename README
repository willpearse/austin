README Austin - MCMC sampling for ecologists
Will Pearse (wdpearse@umn.edu)

Overview:
This is intended to be a quick way of doing MCMC sampling, and I'm aiming it primarily at ecologists because I am one.
I have made very little attempt at making this code generally usable for other people - please do try, and please do email me, but I'd suggest you consider using something like Filzbach (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/filzbach/).

Requirements:
* GNU Scientific Library (for statistical distributions)
* C++11 or higher (for threading)

Suggestions:
* Write your own likelihood (DataModel class), prior (DataModel class), data loading (DataModel class constructor), and proposal (Chain class) functions. This way the program will do what you want to do.
* Look at the examples I give in the main.cpp file - these should show you how to get started
* If you're actually using this for real, then please make sure you email me first. That's not just because it's a requirement of the license (...) but also because there're likely some horrible bugs in here that I haven't told you about or found!
